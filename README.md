Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing customer support tickets to identify common issues, trends, and inefficiencies in ticket resolution processes. By performing sentiment analysis on ticket descriptions and analyzing resolution times, the goal is to provide actionable insights to improve response times and customer satisfaction. The project also includes visualizations of ticket resolution patterns and common issues faced by customers.

Deliverables:

• Customer Support Sentiment Model: A machine learning model that classifies ticket descriptions based on customer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

• Ticket Status Dashboard: A dynamic dashboard displaying ticket status distribution, common issues, and sentiment insights.

• Resolution Time Analysis: Visual representations of resolution times, highlighting areas for improvement in support processes.

• Insightful Report: A detailed report summarizing the key findings, actionable insights, and recommendations for improving customer support operations.

Methodologies:

• Data Extraction: Used dataset containing customer support ticket data (ticket description, status, resolution time, etc.).

• Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the ticket descriptions by removing stopwords, special characters, and normalizing text for sentiment analysis.

• Sentiment Analysis: Performed sentiment classification on ticket descriptions to identify customer sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed ticket volume, status distribution, resolution time, and customer feedback ratings.

• Data Visualization: Created visualizations to highlight trends, such as sentiment distribution over time and resolution time analysis.

Steps:

1.	Data Preprocessing
o	Extract Data: Gather ticket data (status, description, resolution time, etc.).
o	Clean Data: Remove missing values, special characters, and standardize text (e.g., convert to lowercase, remove stopwords) to prepare it for analysis.

3.	Sentiment Analysis
o	Sentiment Classification: Use NLP techniques (like TextBlob) to classify ticket descriptions into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
o	Label Sentiment: Assign sentiment labels to each ticket description for further analysis.

5.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Ticket Status Distribution: Analyze the distribution of ticket statuses (open, closed, pending).
o	Resolution Time Analysis: Calculate the average resolution time and visualize the distribution of resolution times.

7.	Data Visualization
o	Resolution Time & Sentiment Distribution: Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, time series analysis) to track sentiment distribution and ticket resolution times over time.
o	Trend Analysis: Use visualizations to display trends such as the most frequent ticket issues, sentiment shifts, or any significant spikes in customer support activity.

9.	Report Writing
o	Model Performance: Summarize the results of the sentiment analysis and model evaluation, including performance metrics.
